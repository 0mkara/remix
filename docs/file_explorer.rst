File Explorer
=============

The file explorer list by default all the files (under `browser`) stored in your browser. Files can be renamed, removed, added.

Note that clearing the browser storage will permanently delete all the solidity sources you wrote.

A solution would be to use Remixd (see :doc:`../tutorial_remixd_filesystem`)

From the left to the right:

Create new File
---------------

This action will create a new file in the `browser` explorer.

Add Local File
--------------

This allows to select files from the filesystem and import them to the remix browser storage.

Publish to Gist
---------------

This allows to publish files from the browser storage to an anonymous public gist.

Copy to another instance
------------------------

This allows to copy files from the browser storage to another instance (URL) of Remix.

Connect to Localhost
--------------------

This allows to use file located in your file system (see :doc:`../tutorial_remixd_filesystem`).
